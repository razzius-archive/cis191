Project 3: Git, PHP, Python

In the dotfiles directory are my configuration files for zsh and emacs, my shell and editor of choice.

In the html directory, and its subdirectory cgi-bin, are the following scripts:

index.php: Calls python scripts with parameters related to the browser which requested the page, and uses the python
output to display the number of visitors and some information about the user-agents that the website has seen.

count.cgi: A python script that reads from count.txt to keep track of how many times the page has been loaded.
It would be preferable to use a database for such purposes, but static files seem to play nicely with apache.

agents.cgi: A python script that loads data from agents.p, a pickled python dictionary with all of the user agents of
previous requests, outputs some information about the agents handled thus far, and updates agents.p.

agents.p and count.txt: Store information related to usage for use with the python scripts.

This public directory means that any other student could easily copy my source, OPEN SOURCE 4EVA but academic honesty
takes precidence. Do work!
